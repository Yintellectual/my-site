Version 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT - 3:40pm 17th November 2015

This is the first webapp for my personal website 2d23.com. 

This webapp is used to share some articles to my friends and co-workers. 
These shared articles can be study notes, ideas, and stories of mine or outside resources.

In the next version that will come very soon, a forum will be created to handle comments and feedbacks.

This webapp is based on Spring MVC 4.x.x technology. 

In this very first version, the view technology will be pure HTML5+CSS3, no models are introduced.
